0,engineer,proximity,opening,0,"So you finally decided to wake up, huh?"
1,engineer,onclick,opening,1,Well quit gawping and make yourself useful! I can't fix this plane without parts.
2,engineer,onclick,opening,2,I saw plenty of crashed planes on the other islands - get over there and do some salvaging!
3,engineer,onclick,opening,3,"Someone's left a boat by the shore. I checked it over, looks sturdy enough."
4,engineer,onclick,opening,4,There's a list of what I need over by those crates.
5,engineer,onclick,opening,5,What are you waiting for? We've got about four minutes before the next storm rolls in.
6,engineer,onclick,opening,6,Get on with it and let me work.
7,engineer,proximity,first return,0,"You're back! Boat didn't sink, then. What have you got for me?"
8,engineer,proximity,second return,0,What took you so long?
9,engineer,proximity,third return,0,You're getting the hang of this - what have you got there?
10,engineer,proximity,fourth return,0,"Gah, this grease gets everywhere. I can't wait to get home and have a bath."
11,engineer,proximity,fifth return,0,I can't believe I'm stuck here with thi - Oh hey you're back!
12,engineer,proximity,sixth return,0,What I'd do for a drink right now... hey pass me the sprocket wrench would you?
13,engineer,onclick,if correct items,0,Yes! This will fix the engine mounting perfectly.
14,engineer,onclick,if correct items,1,"What do you want, a medal? Get back out there!"
15,engineer,onclick,if correct items,0,"Well look at you, like a puppy with the mail."
16,engineer,onclick,if correct items,1,"This is perfect. Thank you, dear."
17,engineer,onclick,if correct items,0,"I think if I hook it up right, this could be a replacement compressor fan."
18,engineer,onclick,if correct items,1,"I wouldn't call it 'dangerous' dear, no. Don't be so alarmist."
19,engineer,onclick,if correct items,0,"I wouldn't normally use this sort of stabiliser spring, but needs must."
20,engineer,onclick,if correct items,1,It's either use this or be stuck here forever.
21,engineer,onclick,if incorrect items,0,That's not what I asked for - check the list by the crates!
22,engineer,onclick,if incorrect items,1,"I'm not asking for the world, here."
23,engineer,onclick,if incorrect items,0,"Don't be a fool, I need a screw lug, not a spark plug!"
24,engineer,onclick,if incorrect items,1,"Honestly, I don't know how they let you fly this thing."
25,engineer,onclick,if incorrect items,0,"Jesus, can't you read?! Why would you bring me an afterburner foretube?"
26,engineer,onclick,if incorrect items,1,My mother warned me about women like you.
27,engineer,onclick,if incorrect items,0,Did you get that from a plane engine or a steam engine?
28,engineer,onclick,if incorrect items,1,"Of course it's not going to fit, you damn fool!"
29,engineer,onclick,if plane finished,0,"Okay, hand me the part... and the tensioner - that's the one, on the left..."
30,engineer,onclick,if plane finished,1,...that should do the trick! She's back up and running!
31,engineer,onclick,if plane finished,2,"I am a genius, and you... you're good at running errands."
32,engineer,onclick,if plane finished,3,Let's grab our stuff and get out of here.

56,scrapseller,onclick,fourth meeting,4,"I mean what's all this about a war, eh?"
57,scrapseller,onclick,fourth meeting,5,"It's no war, just a couple having a fall out."
58,scrapseller,onclick,fourth meeting,6,"They're both giants though, so I suppose it might *sound* like a war."

71,radiodude,proximity,first meeting,0,"Oh, hello!"
72,radiodude,onclick,first meeting,1,"My name's Davie, you might have heard me on the radio?"
73,radiodude,onclick,first meeting,2,I don't get many visitors.
74,radiodude,onclick,first meeting,3,"That plane that went down was you, I assume?"
75,radiodude,onclick,first meeting,4,"I'm sorry, you'll find it's not so bad here, really."
76,radiodude,onclick,first meeting,5,Oh you're leaving? Good luck with that.
77,radiodude,onclick,first meeting,6,Many have tried...
78,radiodude,proximity,second meeting,0,"And now, for th- woah hey stop making noise - I'm recording!"
79,radiodude,onclick,second meeting,1,Aww I'm going to have to scrap that whole bit now.
80,radiodude,onclick,second meeting,2,Of course I record them in advance! Going out live is scary!
81,radiodude,onclick,second meeting,3,What if some crazy lady came onto your island and interrupted you?
82,radiodude,onclick,second meeting,4,Or..or a crab nipped your toe?
83,radiodude,onclick,second meeting,5,"You've got to pre-record all of it, there's no other way."
84,radiodude,proximity,third meeting,0,"Oh hey! Still here, huh?"
85,radiodude,onclick,third meeting,1,"No I'm not saying you can't leave, it's just not many do."
86,radiodude,onclick,third meeting,2,That old scrap dealer - he tried to leave for years but never managed it.
87,radiodude,onclick,third meeting,3,"I think he's settled in now, got used to it."
88,radiodude,onclick,third meeting,4,"Island life isn't so bad -  you've got the ocean, the sand..."
89,radiodude,onclick,third meeting,5,...me on the radio.
90,radiodude,onclick,third meeting,6,"I'd stop all the rushing around and get settled in, if I were you."
91,radiodude,proximity,fourth meeting,0,Back again? Come for advice?
92,radiodude,onclick,fourth meeting,1,"Okay, well I was just offering."
93,radiodude,onclick,fourth meeting,2,"Alright, alright! Next time I won't ask. What did you come here for then?"
94,radiodude,onclick,fourth meeting,3,"No, you can't use my radio to call for help."
95,radiodude,onclick,fourth meeting,4,"What, you don't think I've tried?"
96,radiodude,onclick,fourth meeting,5,"Nothing gets through the storm, believe me - too much electromagnetism."
97,radiodude,onclick,fourth meeting,6,It's not going to blow over - that same storm's being going since I was in short trousers.
98,radiodude,onclick,fourth meeting,7,"It's just a fact of life, you've got to accept it."
99,radiodude,proximity,fifth meeting,8,Good to see you again!
100,radiodude,onclick,,,Does it feel like we've been here before?
101,radiodude,,,,Sometimes it's difficult to tell.
102,radiodude,,,,"What do you think of the programme, by the way?"
103,radiodude,,,,Well I don't think *you're* very luxury.
104,radiodude,,,,"And it's not made up, every word is true."
105,radiodude,,,,I'm just very good at making it *seem* fantastical.
106,radiodude,,,,That's where the 'luxury' comes in.
